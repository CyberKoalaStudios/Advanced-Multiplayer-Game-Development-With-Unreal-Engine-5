# Using the project with Unreal Engine 5.3 and higher

Here you can find some advice on how to make the project files fully functional with Unreal Engine 5.3 and higher. 
You can find a project version compatible with Unreal Engine 5.3 [here](https://github.com/CyberKoalaStudios)

## Chapter ??

Starting from **Unreal Engine 5.3** the `BlueprintPure` function specifier (used in _Chapter ??_, Using Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs)_) is no longer supported in interface classes. 
This means your code won't compile in **Unreal Engine 5.3** once you add the `PS_Interactable.h` interface.

To make your code fully operational and buildable, you will need to change, inside the `PS_Interactable.h` file the following line of code:

```cpp
UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable, BlueprintNativeEvent, BlueprintPure, Category = "Interaction", meta=(DisplayName="Can Interact"))
bool CanInteract(AUS_Character* CharacterInstigator) const;
```

to

```cpp
UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable, BlueprintNativeEvent, Category = "Interaction", meta=(DisplayName="Can Interact"))
bool CanInteract(AUS_Character* CharacterInstigator) const;
```

## Chapter ??

### Page ??

Starting from **Unreal Engine 5.3**, the _Consume Input_ checkbox seems to be no longer available.
So if you are on UE 5.3 and wondering why the book isn't mentioning the character attacking infinitely fast and messing up the montage, you probably need to add the Pressed trigger.
